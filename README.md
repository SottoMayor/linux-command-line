# Personal Linux Command Line Docs - Bash

## Basic Informations

### Commands

* A **Full Command** consists of:  
`Command + Option(s) + Argument(s)`

* The most important part of a Full Command is the **Command** itself. Options and Arguments complement it.   
`ls` → Full Command generated by a Command.   
`ls -l -a` → Full Command generated by a Command + Options.   

* Below, these three are equivalent, and in the 2nd and 3rd cases, the order doesn't matter:  
`ls -l -a` = `ls -la` = `ls -al`   

From now on, let's refer to a 'Full Command' simply as 'Command', since there is no risk of confusion.

### Terminal

* **Home directory**: Since we opened the Terminal and the `~` is displayed on the screen, we are in the home directory.

## Write commands in a shell at the prompt

`ls`

`ls -l`

`ls -al`

`clear` -> clear the terminal

## Finding help for commands

**`man [command]`** -> `man ls`   
If we press `/`and enter what behavior we want to get, it tries to find in the list of options   
`man ls [Enter] /comma separed [Enter] it should find if the search term matchs with any option description` 

**`[command] --help`** -> `ls --help`

**`apropos [supposed command]`** -> `apropos list`   
**`apropos "[what the command suppose to do]"`** -> using double quotes we can get an exactly match


## TAB (key) completion

1. completes a file or folder name   
2. makes guesses
   
`ls -l De` followed by the Tab key

`ls -l Do` followed by the Tab key twice

`ls -l Doc` followed by the Tab key

`a` followed by the Tab key

## Helpful keyboard shortcuts

| key combination | result |
|-----------------|---------|
| CRTL + A | Move to beginning of line| 
| CRTL + E | Move to end of line|
| arrows | Move letter by letter|
| CRTL + -> | Move left one word | 
| CRTL + <- | Move right one word |
| CRTL + U | Delete from cursor to line start |
| CRTL + K | Delete from cursor to line end |
| CRTL + SHIFT + C | Copy |
| CRTL + SHIFT + V | Paste |
| (up + down) arrow | courses previous commands |
| CRTL + R | Search command history |
| CRTL + C | Cancel command |



## File system

1. Absolute path: starts with `/`for the file system root.
2. Relative path: does not.

**`file [document]`** -> Determinates the file type

**`stat [document]`** -> display the file or file system status

## Navigating the file system

**`cd`** -> Change Directory
**`pwd`** -> Print Working Directory

Go to Document folder and print the current working directory:
`cd Documents/` 
`pwd`

Using `cd`with directories with blanks:   
1. Invalid command
`cd Exercise Files`   
2. Valid commands possibilities:
2.1: Using double quotes   
    `cd "Exercise Files"`
2.2: Using scape (commom usage)
   `cd Exercise\ Files`

Listen files recursively:   
`ls -R departments/`   

Navigation between directories:  
1. `cd departments/hr/policies` -> go to `departments/hr/policies` directory   
2. `cd ..` -> up one level = `departments/hr`   
3. `cd ..` -> up (more) one level = `departments`   
4. `cd hr/policies` -> down two levels in a row = `departments/hr/policies`   
5. `cd ../../finance/documents` -> down two levels in a row, enter in finance after documents = `departments/finance/documents`   
6. `cd -` -> Back and forth between the previous and current directories   
7. `cd` -> back to the home directory   

## ls command, one of the most useful commands

`ls`

`ls --color=always` -> helpful to represent differents aspects of files

`ls -l` -> use a long listing format (see metadata)

`ls -lh` -> see metadata in human readable way, helpful to verify file sizes.
